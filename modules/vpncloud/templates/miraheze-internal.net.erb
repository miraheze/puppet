# THIS CONFIGURATION FILE IS MANAGED BY PUPPET
# This configuration can be enabled/disabled and controlled by adding the
# network to `/etc/default/vpncloud` and starting/stopping it via
# `/etc/init.d/vpncloud start/stop` on non-systemd systems and via
# `systemctl enable/disable vpncloud@NAME` and
# `service vpncloud@NAME start/stop` on systemd systems.

# The port number on which to listen for data.
# Note: Every VPN needs a different port number.
port: 3210

# List of peers to connect to. Each peer must have port 3210 opened in 
# the firewall (see modules/role/manifests/vpncloud.pp)

# Peer timeout in seconds. The peers will exchange information periodically

magic: "76706e01"

# An optional shared key to encrypt the VPN data. If this option is not set,
# the traffic will be sent unencrypted.
shared_key: "<%= @shared_key %>"

# The encryption method to use ("aes256", or "chacha20"). Most current CPUs
# have special support for AES256 so this should be faster. For older

# Name of the virtual device. Any `%d` will be filled with a free number.

# Set the type of network. There are two options: **tap** devices process
# Ethernet frames **tun** devices process IP packets. [default: `tap`]
device_type: tap

# The mode of the VPN. The VPN can like a router, a switch or a hub. A **hub**
# will send all data always to all peers. A **switch** will learn addresses
# from incoming data and only send data to all peers when the address is
# unknown. A **router** will send data according to known subnets of the
# peers and ignore them otherwise. The **normal** mode is switch for tap
# devices and router for tun devices. [default: `normal`]
mode: normal

# The local subnets to use. This parameter should be in the form
# `address/prefixlen` where address is an IPv4 address, an IPv6 address, or a
# MAC address. The prefix length is the number of significant front bits that
# distinguish the subnet from other subnets. Example: `10.1.1.0/24`.
# Note: Several entries can be separated by spaces.
subnets:
  - 10.0.1.0/24

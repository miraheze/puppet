# This class exists to coordinate all service management related actions,
# functionality and logical units in a central place.
#
# *Note*: "service" is the Puppet term and type for background processes
# in general and is used in a platform-independent way. E.g. "service" means
# "daemon" in relation to Unix-like systems.

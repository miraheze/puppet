# Provision a message-of-the-day script.
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*priority*]
#   If you need this script to load before or after other scripts, you
#   can make it do so by manipulating this value. In most cases, the
#   default value of 50 should be fine. Value should be between 0 and 99
#
# [*content*]
#   If defined, will be used as the content of the motd script.
#   Undefined by default. Mutually exclusive with 'source'.
#
# [*source*]
#   Path to motd script. Undefined by default. Mutually exclusive
#   with 'content'.

## Overview

The Kafka module for managing the installation and configuration of [Apache Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org).

## Module Description

The Kafka module for managing the installation and configuration of Apache Kafka:
it's brokers, producers and consumers.

## Setup

### What Kafka affects

Installs the Kafka package and creates a new service.

### Setup requirements

This module has the following dependencies:

* [deric/zookeeper](https://github.com/deric/puppet-zookeeper)
* [camptocamp/systemd](https://github.com/camptocamp/puppet-systemd)
* [puppet/archive](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-archive)
* [puppetlabs/java](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-java)
* [puppetlabs/stdlib](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-stdlib)

### Beginning with Kafka

To successfully install Kafka using this module you need to have Apache ZooKeeper
already running at localhost:2181. You can specify another ZooKeeper host:port
configuration using the config hash of the kafka::broker class.

The default configuration installs Kafka 0.11.0.3 binaries with Scala 2.11:

```puppet
  class { 'kafka': }
```

If you want a Kafka broker server that connects to ZooKeeper listening on port 2181:

```puppet
  class { 'kafka::broker':
    config => {
      'broker.id'         => '0',
      'zookeeper.connect' => 'localhost:2181'
    }
  }
```

## Usage

You can specify different Kafka binaries packages versions to install. Please
take a look at the different Scala and Kafka versions combinations at the
[Apache Kafka Website](http://kafka.apache.org/downloads.html)

### Installing Kafka version 1.1.0 with scala 2.12

We first install the binary package with:

```puppet
  class { 'kafka':
    version => '1.1.0',
    scala_version => '2.12'
  }
```

Then we set a minimal Kafka broker configuration with:

```puppet
  class { 'kafka::broker':
    config => {
      'broker.id'         => '0',
      'zookeeper.connect' => 'localhost:2181'
    }
  }
```

## Reference

The [reference][1] documentation of this module is generated using [puppetlabs/puppetlabs-strings][2].

## Limitations

This module only supports Kafka >= 0.9.0.0.

This module is tested on the following platforms:

* Debian 8
* Debian 9
* Debian 10
* Ubuntu 16.04
* Ubuntu 18.04

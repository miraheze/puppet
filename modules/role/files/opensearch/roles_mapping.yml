# Any changes done in here will need /usr/local/bin/opensearch-security ran afterwards
# to apply it. This config file isn't directly read rather the script ran inside opensearch-security
# reads the config and inserts it into the index which os-security reads.

# In this file users, backendroles and hosts can be mapped to Security roles.
# Permissions for OpenSearch roles are configured in roles.yml

# HELP: to run the script (make sure to ):
# ./generate-admin-certificate.sh <path to store files, e.g. /root)>
#  copy contents of wikitide-ca.pem
# To convert ca file from crt to pem you do (this script already creates the ca in pem format but useful for converting LetsEncrypt):
# openssl x509 -in <ca>.crt -out <ca>.pem -outform PEM
# to convert private key from rsa to PKCS8:
# openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -in <old_key>.crt -out <new_key>.pem -nocrypt

# No idea why this is here, but this was initially just a command
# (yes, no quotes and all) (and if it were an environment variable,
# it would actually be used here, but nope!)

Clarifications:

The following clarifications are based on my understanding of the GPL.
In case of contradiction, the GPL is the final authority on all of these
matters.


Q1. Can I make modifications to ploticus code?

Yes, but any derivatives must be made freely available as GPL code.
This is because your modifications might be good ones that would be useful to
the ploticus user community.  This makes things fair for all the developers
who have contributed to ploticus code thus far.

You must keep the GPL.txt and Copyright files intact in the source code
directory (add your own "Modifications made by" language to the top of
the Copyright file).  It must be stated in an end-user-accessible copyright or
acknowledgements area that the package is "a GPL derivative of Ploticus
data display engine (c) 1998-2008 Stephen Grubb, freely available from
http://ploticus.sourceforge.net".  I request notification of the availability
of all such derivatives (stevegrubb@gmail.com) so that I can link to them from
the ploticus home page and consider possible inclusion in the main fork.

Q2. Can ploticus be used as part of a commercial (for-profit) product or service?

The GPL allows you to use ploticus to produce graphs for any lawful commercial or
noncommercial purpose, including providing services (automated or by hand) for a fee.
For example, there's no problem with executing a standard unmodified version of ploticus
on your server to produce graphs as part of a fee-based service.

Q3. Can ploticus be included/distributed as part of a non-GPL product?

Selling or distributing ploticus as a non-GPL product offering is prohibited.
Combining or intermingling of ploticus source code with non-GPL source code is
prohibited (thus the libploticus API cannot be used in this context).

However it is possible to distribute ploticus "along side of" non-GPL code if it is
partitioned ("kept at arm's length") from the non-GPL code.  The GPL addresses this issue
here. http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLInProprietarySystem

Partitioning is likely to be sufficient if all of these conditions are met:
1) ploticus (or GPL derivative) must be invoked as an executable, not via the libploticus API;
2) your product must be viable in its own right and essentially usable with or without ploticus;
3) ploticus-supported graphics capability may not be sold as an additional cost option;
4) if you've made modifications to the ploticus code you must abide by section Q1 above.
5) ploticus source code is kept in a separate directory, and the GPL.txt and Copyright files therein kept intact;
6) ploticus identity and authorship must be clearly stated and visible.
It must be stated in a end-user-accessible copyright or acknowledgements area that the product
utilizes "Ploticus data display engine (c) 1998-2008 Stephen Grubb, GPL, freely available
from http://ploticus.sourceforge.net".

I request notification of the availability of all such products (stevegrubb@gmail.com)so that
I can monitor compliance and link to them from the ploticus home page.

If you have questions or need clarification please contact me (stevegrubb@gmail.com) ....
I take an active interest in seeing that these rules are
adhered to, and request notification of any suspected violations.

Q4. How should ploticus be cited if it was used in the production of a published work?

Citation is always appreciated.  Language like this is suggested:
Graphical data displays were produced using Ploticus software (ploticus.sf.net).

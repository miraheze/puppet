# archiver. Remember to add the following lines in the mailman.cfg file:
#
# [archiver.hyperkitty]

# enable: yes
# configuration: /etc/mailman3/mailman-hyperkitty.cfg
#

[general]

# This is your HyperKitty installation, preferably on the localhost. This
# address will be used by Mailman to forward incoming emails to HyperKitty
# for archiving. It does not need to be publicly available, in fact it's
# better if it is not.
base_url: http://localhost:8000/hyperkitty/

# Shared API key, must be the identical to the value in HyperKitty's
# settings.
api_key: <%= @mailman_hyperkitty_api_key %>

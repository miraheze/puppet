# Local settings can be configured without being overwritten by package upgrades, for example
# if you want to increase puppetserver open-files-limit to 10000,
# you need to increase systemd's LimitNOFILE setting, so create a file named
# "/etc/systemd/system/puppetserver.service.d/limits.conf" containing:
#	[Service]
#	LimitNOFILE=10000
# You can confirm it worked by running systemctl daemon-reload
# then running systemctl show puppetserver | grep LimitNOFILE

# https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/EZ-129
# Prior to systemd v228, TasksMax was unset by default, and unlimited. Starting in 228 a default of '512'
# was implemented. This is low enough to cause problems for certain applications. In systemd 231, the
# default was changed to be 15% of the default kernel limit. This explicitly sets TasksMax to 4915,
# which should match the default in systemd 231 and later.
# See https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/3211#issuecomment-233676333

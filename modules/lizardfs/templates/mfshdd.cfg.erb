# mfshdd.cfg(5)
# mount points of HDD drives
#
# Chunkserver unconditionally initialises given paths with its folder
# structures hence to avoid accidentally using empty mount point as storage
# (e.g. when HDD is not mounted) it is recommended to create subfolders
# on the designated HDDs like in the following examples where "/mnt/hdN"
# represent mount points:
#
#/mnt/hd1/lizardfs_vol
#/mnt/hd2/lizardfs_vol
#
#
# The following mount point is marked for removal with '*':
#*/mnt/hd3/lizardfs
/srv/mediawiki-static

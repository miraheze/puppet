## Overview

Icinga 2 is a widely used open source monitoring software. This Puppet module helps with installing and managing
configuration of Icinga 2 on multiple operating systems.

### Notices

For Icinga 2 v2.8.0 and higher version v1.3.4 and above is needed and the parameter repositoryd
can set to false. See issue #403.

## Module Description

This module installs and configures Icinga 2 on your Linux or Windows hosts.

By default it uses packages provided by your distribution's repository or
[Chocolatey] on Windows.

The module can also be configured to use [packages.icinga.com] as the primary repository, which enables you to install
Icinga 2 versions that are newer than the ones provided by your distribution's vendor. All features and objects
available in Icinga 2 can be enabled and configured with this module.

## Setup

### What the Icinga 2 Puppet module supports

* Installation of packages
* Configuration of features
* Configuration of objects (also apply rules)
* Service
* MySQL / PostgreSQL Database Schema Import
* Repository Management
* Certification Authority

### Dependencies

This module depends on:

* [puppetlabs/stdlib] >= 4.16.0
* [puppetlabs/concat] >= 2.1.0

Depending on your setup following modules may also be required:

* [puppetlabs/apt] >= 2.0.0
* [puppetlabs/chocolatey] >= 0.7.0
* [puppet/zypprepo] >= 2.0.0

### Limitations

This module has been tested on:

* Ruby >= 1.9
* Debian 7, 8
* Ubuntu 14.04, 16.04
* CentOS/RHEL 6, 7
    * **Caution:** CentOS 6 comes with Ruby 1.8.7 by default
* OracleLinux 7
* FreeBSD 10, 11
* SLES 12
* Windows Server 2012

Other operating systems or versions may work but have not been tested.

It's recommended to enable the future parser when using this module in combination with exported resources.

## Usage

### Installing Icinga 2

The default class `icinga2` installs and configures a basic installation of Icinga 2. The features `checker`, `mainlog`
and `notification` are enabled by default.

By default, your distribution's packages are used to install Icinga 2. On Windows systems we use the [Chocolatey]
package manager.

Use the `manage_repo` parameter to configure the official [packages.icinga.com] repositories.

``` puppet
class { '::icinga2':
  manage_repo => true,
}
```

*Info:* If you are using the [Icinga Web 2](https://github.com/Icinga/puppet-icingaweb2/) Puppet module on the same
server, make sure to disable the repository management for one of the modules!

If you want to manage the version of Icinga 2, you have to disable the package management of this module and handle
packages in your own Puppet code. The attribute manage_repo is also disabled automattically and you have to manage
a repository within icinga in front of the package resource, i.e. for a RedHat system:

``` puppet
yumrepo { 'icinga-stable-release':
  baseurl  => "http://packages.icinga.com/epel/${::operatingsystemmajrelease}/release/",
  descr    => 'ICINGA (stable release for epel)',
  enabled  => 1,
  gpgcheck => 1,
  gpgkey   => 'http://packages.icinga.com/icinga.key',
  before   => Package['icinga2'],
}

package { 'icinga2':
  ensure => latest,
  notify => Class['icinga2'],
}

class { '::icinga2':
  manage_package => false,
}
```

Note: Be careful with this option: Setting `manage_package` to false means that this module will not install any package at
all, including IDO packages!

### Enabling Features

There are two options how you can enable features:

A default set of features is set with the `features` parameter in the `::icinga2` class:

``` puppet
class { '::icinga2':
  manage_repo => true,
  features    => ['checker', 'mainlog', 'command'],
}
```

To enable a feature and change its configuration, declare the specified feature class:

``` puppet
class { '::icinga2::feature::graphite':
  host                   => '10.10.0.15',
  port                   => 2003,
  enable_send_thresholds => true,
  enable_send_metadata   => true,
}
```

Make sure that you enable features **either** in the `::icinga2` class **or** by declaring the feature class.

### Setting up Icinga IDO

The IDO feature can be enabled either in combination with MySQL or PostgreSQL.

Depending on your database you need to enable the feature `icinga2::feature::idomysql` or `icinga2::feature::idopgsql`.

Both features are capable of importing the base schema into the database, however this is disabled by default.
Updating the database schema to another version is currently not supported.

The IDO features require a pre-existing database and a user with permissions to create schema and edit data.

#### MySQL

When using MySQL we recommend the [puppetlabs/mysql] Puppet module to install the database server, create a database
and manage user permissions. Here's an example how you create a MySQL database with the corresponding user with
permissions by using the [puppetlabs/mysql] module:

``` puppet
include ::icinga2
include ::mysql::server

mysql::db { 'icinga2':
  user     => 'icinga2',
  password => 'supersecret',
  host     => '127.0.0.1',
  grant    => ['SELECT', 'INSERT', 'UPDATE', 'DELETE', 'DROP', 'CREATE VIEW', 'CREATE', 'INDEX', 'EXECUTE', 'ALTER'],
}

class{ '::icinga2::feature::idomysql':
  user          => 'icinga2',
  password      => 'supersecret',
  database      => 'icinga2',
  import_schema => true,
  require       => Mysql::Db['icinga2'],
}
```

#### PostgreSQL

For PostgreSQL we recommend the [puppetlabs/puppetlabs-postgresql] module. You can install the server, create databases
and manage user permissions with the module. Here's an example on how to use it in combination with Icinga 2:

``` puppet
include ::icinga2
include ::postgresql::server

postgresql::server::db { 'icinga2':
  user     => 'icinga2',
  password => postgresql_password('icinga2', 'supersecret'),
}

class{ '::icinga2::feature::idopgsql':
  user          => 'icinga2',
  password      => 'supersecret',
  database      => 'icinga2',
  import_schema => true,
  require       => Postgresql::Server::Db['icinga2'],
}
```

### Clustering Icinga 2

Icinga 2 can run in three different roles:

* in a master zone which is on top of the hierarchy
* in a satellite zone which is a child of a satellite or master zone
* a standalone client node/zone which works as an agent connected to master and/or satellite zones

To learn more about Icinga 2 Clustering, follow the official docs on [distributed monitoring]. The following examples show
how these roles can be configured using this Puppet module.

#### Master

A Master zone has no parent and is usually also the place where you enable the IDO and notification features. A master
sends configurations over the Icinga 2 protocol to satellites and/or clients.

More detailed examples can be found in the [examples] directory.

This example creates the configuration for a master that has one satellite connected. A global zone is created for
templates, and all features of a typical master are enabled.

``` puppet
class { '::icinga2':
  confd     => false,
  features  => ['checker','mainlog','notification','statusdata','compatlog','command'],
  constants => {
    'ZoneName' => 'master',
  },
}

class { '::icinga2::feature::api':
  accept_commands => true,
  # when having multiple masters, you should enable:
  # accept_config => true,
  endpoints       => {
    'master.example.org'    => {},
    'satellite.example.org' => {
      'host' => '172.16.2.11'
    }
  },
  zones           => {
    'master' => {
      'endpoints' => ['master.example.org'],
    },
    'dmz'    => {
      'endpoints' => ['satellite.example.org'],
      'parent'    => 'master',
    },
  }
}

icinga2::object::zone { 'global-templates':
  global => true,
}
```

#### Satellite

A satellite has a parent zone and one or multiple child zones. Satellites are usually created to distribute the
monitoring load or to reach delimited zones in the network. A satellite either executes checks itself or delegates them
to a client.

The satellite has fewer features enabled, but executes checks similar to a master. It connects to a master zone, and to
a satellite or client below in the hierarchy. As parent acts either the master zone, or another satellite zone.

``` puppet
class { '::icinga2':
  confd     => false,
  features  => ['checker','mainlog'],
  constants => {
    'ZoneName' => 'dmz',
  },
}

class { '::icinga2::feature::api':
  accept_config   => true,
  accept_commands => true,
  endpoints       => {
    'satellite.example.org' => {},
    'master.example.org'    => {
      'host' => '172.16.1.11',
    },
  },
  zones           => {
    'master' => {
      'endpoints' => ['master.example.org'],
    },
    'dmz'    => {
      'endpoints' => ['satellite.example.org'],
      'parent'    => 'master',
    },
  }
}

icinga2::object::zone { 'global-templates':
  global => true,
}
```

#### Client

Icinga 2 runs as a client usually on each of your servers. It receives config or commands from a satellite or master
zones and runs the checks that have to be executed locally.

The client is connected to the satellite, which is the direct parent zone.

``` puppet
class { '::icinga2':
  confd     => false,
  features  => ['checker','mainlog'],
}

class { '::icinga2::feature::api':
  pki             => 'none',
  accept_config   => true,
  accept_commands => true,
  endpoints       => {
    'NodeName'              => {},
    'satellite.example.org' => {
      'host' => '172.16.2.11',
    }
  },
  zones           => {
    'ZoneName' => {
      'endpoints' => ['NodeName'],
      'parent'    => 'dmz',
    },
    'dmz'      => {
      'endpoints' => ['satellite.example.org'],
    }
  }
}

icinga2::object::zone { 'global-templates':
  global => true,
}
```

### Config Objects

With this module you can create almost every object that Icinga 2 knows about. When creating objects some parameters are
required. This module sets the same requirements as Icinga 2 does. When creating an object you must set a target for the
configuration.

Here are some examples for some object types:

#### Host
``` puppet
icinga2::object::host { 'srv-web1.fqdn.com':
  display_name  => 'srv-web1.fqdn.com',
  address       => '127.0.0.1',
  address6      => '::1',
  check_command => 'hostalive',
  target        => '/etc/icinga2/conf.d/srv-web1.fqdn.com.conf',
}
```

#### Service
``` puppet
icinga2::object::service { 'uptime':
  host_name      => 'srv-web1.fqdn.com',
  display_name   => 'Uptime',
  check_command  => 'check_uptime',
  check_interval => '600m',
  groups         => ['uptime', 'linux'],
  target         => '/etc/icinga2/conf.d/uptime.conf',
}
```

#### Hostgroup
``` puppet
icinga2::object::hostgroup { 'monitoring-hosts':
  display_name => 'Linux Servers',
  groups       => [ 'linux-servers' ],
  target       => '/etc/icinga2/conf.d/groups2.conf',
  assign       => [ 'host.vars.os == "linux"' ],
}
```

#### Parsing Configuration

To generate a valid Icinga 2 configuration all object attributes are parsed. This simple parsing algorithm takes a
decision for each attribute, whether part of the string is to be quoted or not, and how an array or dictionary is to be
formatted.

Parsing of a single attribute can be disabled by tagging it with -: at the front of the string.
```
   attr => '-:"unparsed string with quotes"'
```
An array, a hash or a string can be assigned to an object attribute. True and false are also valid values.

Hashes and arrays are created recursively, and all parts – such as single items of an array, keys and its values
are parsed separately as strings.

Strings are parsed in chunks, by splitting the original string into separate substrings at specific keywords (operators)
such as `+`, `-`, `in`, `&&`, `||`, etc.

**NOTICE**: This splitting only works for keywords that are surrounded by whitespace, e.g.:
```
   attr => 'string1 + string2 - string3'
```

The algorithm will loop over the parameter and start by splitting it into 'string1' and 'string2 - string3'.
'string1' will be passed to the sub function 'value_types' and then the algorithm will continue parsing the rest of the
string ('string2 - string3'), splitting it, passing it to value_types, etc.

Brackets are parsed for expressions:
```
  attr => '3 * (value1 - value2) / 2'
```

The parser also detects function calls and will parse all parameters separately.
```
  attr => 'function(param1, param2, ...)'
```

True and false can be used as either booleans or strings.
```
  attrs => true or  attr => 'true'
```

In Icinga you can write your own lambda functions with {{ ... }}. For Puppet use:
```
  attrs => '{{ ... }}'
```

The parser analyzes which parts of the string have to be quoted and which do not.

As a general rule, all fragments are quoted except for the following:

* Boolean: `true`, `false`
* Numbers: `3` or `2.5`
* Time Intervals: `3m` or `2.5h`  (s = seconds, m = minutes, h = hours, d = days)
* Functions: `{{ ... }}` or function `()` `{}`
* All constants, which are declared in the constants parameter in main class `icinga2`
    * `NodeName`
* Names of attributes that belong to the same type of object:
    * e.g. `name` and `check_command` for a host object
* All attributes or variables (custom attributes) from the host, service or user contexts:
    * `host.name`, `service.check_command`, `user.groups`, ...

###### What isn't supported?

It's not currently possible to use arrays or dictionaries in a string, like
```
  attr => 'array1 + [ item1, item2, ... ]'
```

Assignments other than simple attribution are not currently possible either, e.g. building something like
```
  vars += config
```
but you can use the following instead:
```
  vars = vars + config
```

#### Reading objects from hiera data

The following example is for puppet 4 and higher. It shows how icinga2 objects can be read from
a hiera datastore. See also examples/objects_from_hiera.pp.

```
class { 'icinga2':
  manage_repo => true,
}

$defaults = lookup('monitoring::defaults')

lookup('monitoring::objects').each |String $object_type, Hash $content| {
  $content.each |String $object_name, Hash $object_config| {
    ensure_resource(
      $object_type,
      $object_name,
      deep_merge($defaults[$object_type], $object_config))
  }
}
```

The datastore could be like:

```
---
monitoring::objects:
  'icinga2::object::host':
    centos7.localdomain:
      address: 127.0.0.1
      vars:
        os: Linux
  'icinga2::object::service':
    ping4:
      check_command: ping4
      apply: true
      assign:
        - host.address
    ssh:
      check_command: ssh
      apply: true
      assign:
        - host.address && host.vars.os == Linux

monitoring::defaults:
  'icinga2::object::host':
    import:
      - generic-host
    target: /etc/icinga2/conf.d/hosts.conf
  'icinga2::object::service':
    import:
      - generic-service
    target: /etc/icinga2/conf.d/services.conf
```


### Apply Rules

Some objects can be applied to other objects. To create a simple apply rule you
must set the `apply` parameter to `true`. If this parameter is set to a string,
this string will be used to build an `apply for` loop. A service object always
targets a host object. All other objects need to explicitly set an
`apply_target`

Apply a SSH service to all Linux hosts:

``` puppet
icinga2::object::service { 'SSH':
  target        => '/etc/icinga2/conf.d/test.conf',
  apply         => true,
  assign        => [ 'host.vars.os == Linux' ],
  ignore        => [ 'host.vars.os == Windows' ],
  display_name  => 'Test Service',
  check_command => 'ssh',
}
```

Apply notifications to services:

``` puppet
icinga2::object::notification { 'testnotification':
  target       => '/etc/icinga2/conf.d/test.conf',
  apply        => true,
  apply_target => 'Service',
  assign       => [ 'host.vars.os == Linux' ],
  ignore       => [ 'host.vars.os == Windows' ],
  user_groups  => ['icingaadmins']
}
```

Assign all Linux hosts to a hostgroup:
``` puppet
icinga2::object::hostgroup { 'monitoring-hosts':
  display_name => 'Linux Servers',
  groups       => [ 'linux-servers' ],
  target       => '/etc/icinga2/conf.d/groups2.conf',
  assign       => [ 'host.vars.os == "linux"' ],
}
```

A loop to create HTTP services for all vHosts of a host object:
``` puppet
icinga2::object::service { 'HTTP':
  target        => '/etc/icinga2/conf.d/http.conf',
  apply         => 'http_vhost => config in host.vars_http_vhost',
  assign        => [ 'host.vars.os == Linux' ],
  display_name  => 'HTTP Service',
  check_command => 'http',
}
```

### CA and Certificates

Handling the CA and certificates is an important part of Icinga 2, because the communication between Icinga processes
requires SSL/TLS client certificates. This module offers multiple choices to configure this.

#### CA on your Icinga Master

One of your Icinga masters needs to behave as a CA. With the class
`icinga2::pki::ca` you can do the following to fulfill this requirement:

* Use the the `icinga2` CLI to generate a complete new CA
``` puppet
include ::icinga2
class { '::icinga2::pki::ca':
}
```

* Set a custom content of the CA certificate and key
``` puppet
include ::icinga2
class { '::icinga2::pki::ca':
  ca_cert => '-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- ...',
  ca_key  => '-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY----- ...',
}
```

* Transfer a CA certificate and key from an existing CA by using the file resource:
``` puppet
include ::icinga2
file { '/var/lib/icinga2/ca/ca.crt':
  source => '...',
  tag    => 'icinga2::config::file',
}

file { '/var/lib/icinga2/ca/ca.key':
  source => '...',
  tag    => 'icinga2::config::file',
}
```

* Create a new CA with the `icinga2` CLI command and a certificate signed by this new CA. This is useful especially when
setting up a new Icinga 2 master.
```puppet
class { '::icinga2':
  constants => {
    'TicketSalt'   => '5a3d695b8aef8f18452fc494593056a4',
  }
}

class { '::icinga2::pki::ca': }

class { '::icinga2::feature::api':
  pki             => 'none',
  endpoints       => {
    'localhost' => {
      'host' => 'localhost',
    }
  },
  zones           => {
    'master' => {
      'endpoints' => ['localhost']
    }
  }
}
```

If you are looking for an option to use your Puppet CA, have a look at the
[Client/Satellite Certificates](#clientsatellite-certificates) section.

#### Client/Satellite Certificates

In addition to the master, each client and satellite needs valid certificates to communicate with other Icinga 2
instances. This module offers following options to create these certificates:

* Use Puppet's CA and its client certificates. This is convenient since you don't need to maintain an additional CA.
``` puppet
include ::icinga2::feature::api
```

* Use a custom function implemented in this module to generate a certificate. This feature will do the following:
  * Generate a key and certificate based on the FQDN of the host
  * Save the certificate of another Icinga 2 instance, usually the Icinga master where your Icinga CA is located
  * Generate a ticket based on the TicketSalt
  * Request a signed certificate at your Icinga CA

``` puppet
class { '::icinga2::feature::api':
  pki             => 'icinga2',
  ca_host         => 'icinga2-master.example.com',
  ticket_salt     => '5a3d695b8aef8f18452fc494593056a4',
  accept_config   => true,
  accept_commands => true,
  endpoints       => {
    'NodeName'                   => {},
    'icinga2-master.example.com' => {
      'host' => '192.168.56.103',
    }
  },
  zones           => {
    'NodeName' => {
      'endpoints' => ['NodeName'],
      'parent'    => 'master',
    },
    'master' => {
      'endpoints' => ['icinga2-master.example.com']
    }
  }
}
```

* Use custom file resources to transfer your own certificate and key
``` puppet
class { '::icinga2::feature::api':
  pki => 'none',
}

file { "/etc/icinga2/pki/${::fqdn}.crt":
  ensure => file,
  tag    => 'icinga2::config::file,
  source => "puppet:///modules/profiles/certificates/${::fqdn}.crt",
}

file { "/etc/icinga2/pki/${::fqdn}.key":
  ensure => file,
  tag    => 'icinga2::config::file,
  source => "puppet:///modules/profiles/private_keys/${::fqdn}.key",
}
```

* Set a custom content for the certificate and key

``` puppet
class { '::icinga2::feature::api':
  pki         => 'none',
  ssl_cacert  => '-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- ...',
  ssl_key     => '-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY----- ...',
  ssl_cert    => '-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- ...',
}
```

* Fine tune TLS / SSL settings

``` puppet
class { '::icinga2::feature::api':
  ssl_protocolmin => 'TLSv1.2',
  ssl_cipher_list => 'HIGH:MEDIUM:!aNULL:!MD5:!RC4',
}
```

### Custom configuration

Sometimes it's necessary to cover very special configurations, that you cannot handle with this module. In this case you
can use the `icinga2::config::file` tag on your file resource. The module collects all file resource types with this
tag and triggers a reload of Icinga 2 on a file change.

``` puppet
include ::icinga2
file { '/etc/icinga2/conf.d/for-loop.conf':
  ensure => file,
  source => '...',
  tag    => 'icinga2::config::file',
}
```

If you want to add custom configuration fragments to existing config files, you can do this with
`icinga2::config::fragment`. It adds content into a specified target to the position you set in the order parameter.
You can use also Puppet templates to set the content of the config fragment.

For example, you can add custom functions to existing config files:

``` puppet
include ::icinga2

icinga2::object::service { 'load':
  display_name  => 'Load',
  apply         => true,
  check_command => 'load',
  assign        => ['vars.os == Linux'],
  target        => '/etc/icinga2/conf.d/service_load.conf',
  order         => '30',
}

icinga2::config::fragment { 'load-function':
  target => '/etc/icinga2/conf.d/service_load.conf',
  order => '10',
  content => 'vars.load_wload1 = {{
    if (get_time_period("backup").is_inside) {
      return 20
    } else {
      return 5
    }
  }}',
}
```

### Public Classes

#### Class: `icinga2`

The default class of this module. It handles the basic installation and configuration of Icinga 2. When you declare this
class, Puppet will do the following:

* Install Icinga 2
* Place a default configuration for the Icinga 2 daemon
* Keep the default configuration of the Icinga 2 package
* Start Icinga 2 and enable the service

This class can be declared without adjusting any parameter:

``` puppet
class { '::icinga2': }
```

**Parameters within `icinga2`:**

##### `ensure`
Defines if the service should be `running` or `stopped`. Defaults to `running`

##### `enable`
If set to `true` the Icinga 2 service will start on boot. Defaults to `true`.

##### `manage_repo`
When set to `true` this module will install the [packages.icinga.com] repository. With this official repo
you can get the latest version of Icinga. When set to `false` the operating systems default will be used. As the Icinga
Project does not offer a [Chocolatey] repository, you will get a warning if you enable this parameter on Windows.
Default is `false`. NOTE: will be ignored if manage_package is set to false.

##### `manage_package`
If set to false packages aren't managed. Defaults to `true`.

##### `manage_service`

# Miraheze's Puppet configuration

[Miraheze](https://meta.miraheze.org/) is a non-profit wiki farm that provides free MediaWiki hosting. Miraheze is powered by volunteers only, and we believe our code should be open source.

This repository contains our production Puppet configuration. Contributions (see below) are always welcome.

Pull requests are welcome!

# Issues

Our issue tracker is in [Phabricator](https://phabricator.miraheze.org/maniphest/). You may directly open a new issue by clicking [here](https://phabricator.miraheze.org/maniphest/task/edit/form/1/). Please read below for security-related concerns.

# Security Vulnerabilities

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any part of our code, please do not post it publicly by using our wikis or bug trackers for that; rather, please read our [security page](https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki/Security) carefully, and follow the instructions.

As a quick overview, you can email security concerns to security@miraheze.org which will open a phabricator task that is hidden from public view. If you'd like, you can instead directly create a security-related task [here](https://phabricator.miraheze.org/maniphest/task/edit/form/2/), but please leave the "Security" project on the issue.
